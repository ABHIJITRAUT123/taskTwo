                <h3 class="challenge">Challenge</h3>
                <p class="challengeText">Being in the chemical industry, gaining the trust of 
                        the consumer was the biggest challenge. To tackle this, we 
                        created specific websites in the native language of their 
                        location. Since, the target audience for UPL is majorly farmers 
                        & small business owners, we ensured that every website is 
                        pixel perfect and easy to scan for the users arriving on the 
                        website. 

                        As is the case, every website loads differently for every 
                        region. Managing the adaptiveness, responsiveness and the 
                        latency of the website was a mammoth mountain to climb. 
                                            
                        Another challenge was to make sure all the UPL sub-
                        websites are laden with the latest technology and a team 
                        that is dedicatedly working to keep all the websites running 
                        and live.</p>
